# About

This repo is a collection of projects to learn about AI and ML

## Projects
[`digit-prediction`](./digit-prediction) predicts the digit in a 8x8 image. 
Implemented the neural network to do so manually 
(forwards, backwards and optimizers all manually implemented) in numpy and with pytorch.

[`reinforcement-learning`](./reinforcement-learning) 
implements different reinforcement learning techniques and algorithms. 
For example, this project implements: Q-Learning, Value Iteration, Model Based Value Iteration,
and Deep Q-Learning
